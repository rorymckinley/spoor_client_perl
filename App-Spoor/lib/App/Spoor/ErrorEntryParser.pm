=head1 NAME

App::Spoor::ErrorEntryParser

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This package contains the necessary functionality to parse CPanel error log entries.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 parse

This subroutine accepts a single line from a CPanel error log (as a string) and returns a reference to a hash 
representation of that entry.

The hash representation contains the following elements:

=over 2

=item * type: This is hardcoded to 'error'

=item * event: A description of the event that the entry refers to - can be one of forward_added_partial_recipient, unrecognised.

=item * log_time: A DateTime instance representing the time of the log entry. It is not set if the event is 'unrecognised'.

=item * context: The context within which the operation is being performed can be either 'mailbox' or 'domain'. It is not set if the event is 'unrecognised'.

=item * forward_type: Can be one of 'system_user', 'pipe' or 'email'. It is not set if the event is 'unrecognised'.

=item * forward_to: The recipient of the forwarded email. It is not set if the event is 'unrecognised'.

=item * email: The mailbox that the forward is being applied to. It is not set if the event is 'unrecognised'.

=item * status: The status of the request is hardcoded to success. It is not set if the event is 'unrecognised'.
