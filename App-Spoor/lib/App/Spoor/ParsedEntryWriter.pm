=head1 NAME

App::Spoor::ParsedEntryWriter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Writes a parsed log entry as json to a file in /var/lib/spoor/parsed.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 write_parsed_entry

For parsed entries that meet the criteria, this subroutine writes the entry as JSON to a file located in /var/lib/spoor/parsed.

Currently the criteria only allows for parsed entries with the following characteristics to be written:

=over 2

=item * A successful login event with a mailbox context.

=item * A successful forward added partial entry (IP) with a mailbox context.

=item * A successful forward added partial entry (Recipient) with a mailbox context, that is forwarding to a email address.

=item * A successful forward removed entry with a mailbox context.

=back

The created filenames adhere to the pattern "type.timestamp.random_element.json", where 'type' would be the type of log
that produced the entry ('login', 'access', 'error'), 'timestamp' is the unix timestamp at the time of file creation and
the random element is a random integer between 1000000 and 1999999 (inclusive).

  my $entry = '[2018-09-19 16:02:36 +0000] info [webmaild] 10.10.10.10 ' . 
    '- rorymckinley@blah.capefox.co (possessor: blahuser) - SUCCESS LOGIN webmaild';

  $parsed_entry_ref = App::Spoor::LoginEntryParser::parse($entry);

  App::Spoor::ParsedEntryWriter::write_parsed_entry($parsed_entry_ref, App::Spoor::Config::get_application_config());

The subroutine does not return anything of significance.
