=head1 NAME

App::Spoor::Security

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Performs rudimentary permission and ownership checks of Spoor-related files and directories

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=head2 check_config_file

Checks that the spoor config file is owner by the specified user and has permissions '0600'.

  App::Spoor::Security::check_config_file($<) || die("blah blah blah");

  # Optionally, you can pass in an alternative to the root path '/' which is used when building the path
  # to the config file. In the code snippet below, the code will look for the config file in
  # /tmp/etc/spoor/ instead of /etc/spoor. This is primarily used to support testing.
  App::Spoor::Security::check_config_file($<, '/tmp') || die("blah blah blah");

sub check_config_file {
  my $required_user_id = shift;
  my $root_path = shift @_ // '/';

  my @file_stat = stat "$root_path/etc/spoor/spoor.yml";

  my $file_permissions = $file_stat[2] & 07777;
  
  $file_user_id == $required_user_id && $file_permissions == 0600;
}

=head2 check_file

Checks that a given file is owned by the specified user and has the permissions specified.

  App::Spoor::Security::check_file(shift, $>, 0600) || die("blah blah blah");

=cut

  my $path = shift;

  my $user_id = $stat[4];
  my $permissions = $stat[2] & 07777;
  
  $user_id == $required_user_id && $permissions == $required_permissions;
}

=head2 check_config_directory

Checks that the spoor config directory is owned by the specified user and has permissions '0700'.

  App::Spoor::Security::check_config_directory($<) || die("blah blah blah");

  # Optionally, you can pass in an alternative to the root path '/' which is used when building the path
  # to the config file. In the code snippet below, the code will look for the config directory in
  # /tmp/etc/ instead of /etc. This is primarily used to support testing.

  my $permissions = $stat[2] & 07777;
  
  $user_id == $required_user_id && $permissions == 0700;
}

=head2 check_persistence_directory

Checks that the spoor persistence directory is owned by the specified user and has permissions '0700'.

  App::Spoor::Security::check_persistence_directory($<) || die("blah blah blah");

  # Optionally, you can pass in an alternative to the root path '/' which is used when building the path
  # to the config file. In the code snippet below, the code will look for the persistence directory in
  # /tmp/var/lib instead of /var/lib. This is primarily used to support testing.
  App::Spoor::Security::check_persistence_directory($<, '/tmp') || die("blah blah blah");

=cut

  my $required_user_id = shift;
  my $root_path = shift @_ // '/';

  my @stat = stat "$root_path/var/lib/spoor";
  my $user_id = $stat[4];
  my $permissions = $stat[2] & 07777;
  
  $user_id == $required_user_id && $permissions == 0700;
}

=head2 check_parsed_persistence_directory

Checks that the spoor parsed persistence directory is owned by the specified user and has permissions '0700'.

  App::Spoor::Security::check_persistence_directory($<) || die("blah blah blah");

  # Optionally, you can pass in an alternative to the root path '/' which is used when building the path
  # to the config file. In the code snippet below, the code will look for the parsed items directory in
  # /tmp/var/lib/spoor instead of /var/lib/spoor. This is primarily used to support testing.
